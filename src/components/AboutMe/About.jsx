                        Hello, my name is Ã–mer Ulusal and I am a Full Stack web developer. Constant learning and being open to innovation are crucial for me. Additionally, I prioritize writing clean code and can adapt to teamwork easily. Although I haven't worked at a company before, I have completed numerous projects and shared some of them on my GitHub account. These projects have strengthened my frontend web development skills and experience.
                        I have been making electronic music for about 7 years and have knowledge of 3D modeling. These experiences enhance my imagination and creativity while also providing me with a unique perspective. With these aspects, I believe I possess various skills and knowledge in many different fields and can make a difference in a work environment.
